<span class="i0">I dreamed that, wandering by a river's bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came across a lonely ship that sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lifeless waters. Day was dim;&mdash;in dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see nor sun, nor moon; unearthly gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deadened light fall strangely from the sky.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were but three that struggled not to die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man, a woman, and a tender child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought to save them both with effort wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dragged his love to the entangled shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But down the slimy weeds she slid once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the water, and her lover's breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received her, and together they found rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child was saved; my hand towards her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outstretched, drew all her sweetness to the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where naked, like a lily wet with rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sank and loudly wept at her life's gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite small she was, and light; I bore her fast<br /></span><span class='pn'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To what seemed home, and there she smiled at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat upright within my arms; I found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright-hued veil wherein to wrap her round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tissues that far in morning-lands were spun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those who love the flowers and the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I laid her softly in a silken bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewed fragrant violets about her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left her.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">'Twas my dream then that I slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when at dawn unto her bed I crept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child was lost. Her pillow was all wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears that still flowed on; and faster yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flowed in quickening rills, until I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood beside a torrent wide that sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unknown sea. The day was sad, tho' young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a misty branch some bird had sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left a trembling silence; all around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the little daisies on the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast closed, with folded arm-petals in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shielding their yellow hearts from the cold rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;A voice invisible made murmur then:<br /></span><span class='pn'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Come here and look upon these poor drowned men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship was sunk a year ago to-day....'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I stepped back and shuddering turned away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I had never seen the face of Death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Fear itself soon drew me with quick breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the place, even to the river's brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I had seen that lonely vessel sink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in waters deep I saw them lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands at rest and eyes that sought the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear eyes wide open to an unseen day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wondrous silence motionless they lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With white lips smiling on their spirit's bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Is Death but this?' I cried, 'no more but this?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answer came: 'Among those faces there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all unknown?'<br /></span>
<span class="i6">'Twas then I saw him, fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With perfect peace, my enemy, even he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the world who most had tortured me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lay there, blessed among the blessed, and smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes more pure than any wakening child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little waves in passing&mdash;like the breeze<br /></span><span class='pn'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That stirs the foliage of the unmoved trees&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played in their hair, and fluttering grasses rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell and danced about their mute repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I gazed on until I too had drunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their lips' joy, until their peace had sunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into my troubling earth-stirred heart that ached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join them ... and then waked....<br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
